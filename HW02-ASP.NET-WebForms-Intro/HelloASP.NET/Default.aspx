            App_data folder contains any db's that we may use (local db in most cases).

            App_start folder configurates our app. It adds all the content (css/js) into single files, minifies and uglifies them. Route config contains the settings for what action to be executed when a page is accessed as a url. It can limit access if a user is not authorised.
        </p>

            Content folder contains our css files that are going to be bundled up.

            Fonts folder contains our font files that are going to be bundled up.

            There are 3 default aspx pages - About, Default and Contact. They are used to form the sample app. In most cases they are deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Site.master file is a master page, from which all other pages inherit and re-use its layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Global.asax is the code that executes on startup - it calls all the classes in App_Start and configurates them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web.config (deriving from machine config) is used to configurate our app (both in debug and release mode). In most cases contains info about connection strings, access rights to different routs, route maps etc.

        <h3>Code behind</h3>
        <p>
            Many languages use the concept of mixing code and html - for easier and dynamic html content generation. In most of them the code becomes very hard to read and maintain. This is where the concept for codebehind comes - every single page has its own codebehind that is used to hold the busines logic. This way the html remains code free and the code remains html - free.
